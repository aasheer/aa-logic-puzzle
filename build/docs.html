      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Your task is to build this game:
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src='img/Test-overview.jpg' width='404'>
      </p>
      <p>
        All the assets (pre-cut) are in
        <code>img</code>
        , please place your working app in
        <a href='app.html'>app.html</a>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to leverage
        <a href='http://haml.info/'>haml</a>
        ,
        <a href='http://sass-lang.com/'>sass</a>
        , and
        <a href='http://coffeescript.org/'>coffeescript</a>
        , this project is set up for
        <a href='http://middlemanapp.com/'>Middleman</a>
        . Read about it at
        <a href='http://middlemanapp.com/getting-started/'>their website</a>
        and edit the files in
        <code>source</code>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        Certainly feel free to complete this project using vanilla html,
        css, and javascript. If you want to take that approach, edit the
        files in
        <code>build</code>
        .
      </p>
      <h2>Puzzle</h2>
      <p>
        The puzzle you're building is a simple logic puzzle. You have to fill
        in the squares to coorespond with the hints along the top and down the
        side.
      </p>
      <p>
        The hints tell you how many squares in that row or column should
        be filled in. For example in the sample image along the top the first
        number is '1', which indicates that there is one square filled in in
        that column. Similarly the bottom number along the left is '2', which
        indicates that there are two squares filled in in that row (they don't
        have to touch).
      </p>
      <h2>Interactions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Clicking on a tile should toggle that tile on and off</li>
        <li>
          Clicking on "New Puzzle" should query the server for a new puzzle
          and set it up. It should clear out any existing tile selections
        </li>
        <li>Clicking on "Check Solution" should transmit the solution back to
        the server to see if it's valid
        <ul><li>Extra credit for checking in the browser first and then
        transmitting to the server!</li></ul></li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Tests</h2>
      <p>
        There are
        <a href='http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/'>jasmine</a>
        specs in
        <a href='spec.html'>spec.html</a>
        that you need to make pass.
        They should give you some idea of what code you need to write as well.
      </p>
      <h2>Trouble</h2>
      <p>
        If you run into any trouble, please
        <a href='mailto:jszmajda@optoro.com'>email me</a>
        and ask me for help.
