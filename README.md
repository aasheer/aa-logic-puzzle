# Welcome!

Please don't fork this project, don't give away the solution!

## Setup

This project is set up to use Middleman, a ruby-based static site
builder. Feel free to solve the project using the static html,
javascript, and css you find in the `build` folder, but for bonus points
solve it using the haml, sass, and coffeescript you're provided using
Middleman.

More information on Middleman is available at http://middlemanapp.com/

## The Task

The challenge is to build a puzzle-playing app using html, css, and
javascript. A full description of the application is available in the
**docs.html** file.
